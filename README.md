# React Native Material Design TextInput

React Native TextInput styled with Material Design.

## Installation
```
npm install react-native-md-textinput
```

## Usage

I'm going to refer to the `react-native-md-textinput` Component as `TextField`. You can name it whatever you like when importing it.

The most basic usage is to import the `TextField` Component and render it with the props `label` and `highlightColor`. Note that this example uses the [ScrollView](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/scrollview.html) Component. This allows the keyboard to be dismissed when users tap outside the input and keyboard area.

```javascript
import TextField from 'react-native-md-textinput';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ScrollView>
        <TextField label={'Name'} highlightColor={'#00BCD4'} />
      </ScrollView>
    );
  }
}
```

### TextInput

To customize the `TextInput` that is rendered inside the `TextField` Component, simply pass props the `TextInput` accepts to the `TextField` Component. You can find the props the `TextInput` Component accepts [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html#props).

Here is an example of how to change the keyboard type to `numeric`.

```javascript
import TextField from 'react-native-md-textinput';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ScrollView>
        <TextField
          label={'Name'}
          highlightColor={'#00BCD4'}
          keyboardType={'numeric'}
        />
      </ScrollView>
    );
  }
}
```

### Dense Styling

To use the "dense" styling that matches the [Material Design Style Guide](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-labels), you can set the prop `dense` to `true`. By default, this prop is set to `false`.

## Props

Below are the props you can pass to the React Component to customize the TextInput.

Prop | Type | Default | description
-----|------|---------|------------
label | string | | This string appears as the label.
highlightColor | string | | This string represents the hex code, rgb, or rgba color of the TextInput label and underline when it is active/focused on.
duration | number | `200` | A number representing the duration of floating label and underline animations in milliseconds.
labelColor | string | `#9E9E9E` | This string represents the hex code, rgb, or rgba color of the TextInput label when it is inactive.
textColor | string | `#000` | This string represents the hex code, rgb, or rgba color of the text entered in the TextInput. Note: If you set textFocusColor or textBlurColor, those colors will override this one during the corresponding state of the TextInput.
textFocusColor | string | | This string represents the hex code, rgb, or rgba color of the text entered in the TextInput when it is active/focused on.
textBlurColor | string | | This string represents the hex code, rgb, or rgba color of the text entered in the TextInput when it is inactive.
borderColor | string | `#E0E0E0` | This string represents the hex code, rgb, or rgba color of the TextInput underline when it is inactive.
dense | bool | `false` | If true, it will render the "dense" input field which is smaller in height and has smaller font sizes. You can view more [here](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-labels).
multiline | bool | `false` | If true, it will allow multiline text input
height | number | `undefined` | A number representing the initial height of the textInput
autoGrow | bool | `false` | If true enables autogrow of the textInput 
underlineColorAndroid | string | `rgba(0,0,0,0)` | This sets the default underline color on Android to transparent ([Issue #1](https://github.com/evblurbs/react-native-md-textinput/issues/1)).
secureTextAllowUnmask | bool | `false` | This allows the secure password area to be unmasked.
secureTextAllowUnmaskIconOn | element | `false` | This is the icon that is displayed when secureTextAllowUnmask is true
secureTextAllowUnmaskIconOff | element | `false` | This is the icon that is displayed when secureTextAllowUnmask is true and the user has clicked the secureTextAllowUnmaskIconOn element

### Style Overrides

The main purpose of this component is to easily add a TextInput that matches the [Material Design Style Guide](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-labels). With that said, there have been requests (i.e. [PR #4](https://github.com/evblurbs/react-native-md-textinput/pull/4)) to style the component beyond the [Material Design Style Guide](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/text-fields.html#text-fields-labels). I've added the props below to allow you to do exactly that. **DO THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK**. Changing the layout requires an understanding of the main elements of this component (i.e. FloatingLabel, the Viewwrapper, and the TextInput), and may cause compatibility issues between Android and iOS ([Issue #2](https://github.com/evblurbs/react-native-md-textinput/issues/2)). I'll try to support any issues with these props, but they will be treated as second class citizens.

Prop | Type | Default | description
-----|------|---------|------------
inputStyle | Object | | Object to override the styles of the TextInput.<sup>[1](#reactStyleObject)</sup>
wrapperStyle | Object | | Object to override the styles of the View that wraps the TextInput.<sup>[1](#reactStyleObject)</sup>
labelStyle | Object | | Object to override the styles of the Label that animates on focus of the TextInput.<sup>[1](#reactStyleObject)</sup>

<a name="reactStyleObject">1</a>: Object to override styles needs to match the format of [inline styles](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html). You can find the supported properties [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style.html#supported-properties).
